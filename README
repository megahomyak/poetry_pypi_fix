This repository exists as a reminder for me of what to do when faced with "Could not find a matching version of package" with Poetry. Dropping caches works. Here's how to do it:

> poetry cache clear --all .

or, maybe,

> poetry cache clear --all PyPI

----------------

Maybe, installing it through global `pip` might help?? It helped when I did it, and even twice, but this might be a coincidence
